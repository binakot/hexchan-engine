# hexchan-engine
Hexchan-engine is an anonymous imageboard software written in Python using Django framework.

What's an *imageboard*, you may ask. It's a webforum, where you can post messages without registration 
and pictures are typically used to communicate all sorts of ideas, thus *imageboard*. 
An example would be the infamous 4chan.org.

## Is it deployed somewhere?
Yes, it powers an already existing Russian imageboard **Hexchan** at https://hexchan.org
Feel free to visit us and leave a message in English or Russian.

## Can I use it?
Of course! Hexchan-engine is licensed under MIT license, so you may use it to make your own imageboard.
Although we wouldn't recommend doing this right now, the engine is still a work in progress. 
Also there is no installation manual yet. Stay tuned for our first release!
